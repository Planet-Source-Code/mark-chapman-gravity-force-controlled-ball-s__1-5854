## Gravity / Force Controlled Ball \(s\)


</div>

### Description

I posted a first version, but this is better so CHECK IT OUT ! You can create balls that bounce arond the screen interacting with each other. They take into acccount gravity and force. Each ball has its own force and when it hits another force is passed through to it. The balls bounce as if it is in real life. You can increase and decrease both the force and the gravity.

The code is done by Using INSTANCES OF A CLASS - so if you want to learn classes look at this it will help

This is really cool so check it out !
